# ATV_Transmission_Project

#Overview

Welcome to the Baja ATV Transmission System Project repository! This project documents the design and fabrication process of the transmission system for our Baja ATV, which served as the culmination of my bachelor's degree program.

#Background

As part of our Baja SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) team, we were tasked with designing and building an off-road vehicle capable of withstanding the rigors of various challenges in the Baja SAE competition. One of the critical components of our vehicle was the transmission system, responsible for transferring power from the engine to the wheels efficiently and reliably.

#Objectives

Our primary objective was to design and fabricate a robust transmission system optimized for off-road performance. This involved:

Conducting thorough research into transmission system design principles and best practices.
Collaborating with team members to conceptualize and refine design ideas.
Utilizing CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software to create detailed 3D models of transmission components.
Performing engineering analyses, including stress analysis and gear ratio calculations, to ensure the reliability and performance of the system.
Fabricating transmission components using a combination of machining, welding, and assembly techniques.
Testing the transmission system under simulated off-road conditions to validate its functionality and durability.

#Contributions

As the head of the transmission systems team and vice captain of our Baja SAE team, I played a central role in leading the design and fabrication efforts. My responsibilities included:

Overseeing the design process, ensuring alignment with project objectives and specifications.
Coordinating with team members to assign tasks and manage project timelines.
Providing technical expertise in transmission system design and fabrication.
Collaborating with other subsystem teams to integrate the transmission system with the vehicle chassis and drivetrain.
Participating in testing and iteration phases to optimize the performance of the transmission system.

#Conclusion

The successful completion of the Baja ATV Transmission System Project represents the culmination of months of hard work, collaboration, and innovation. This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of our efforts and achievements, providing valuable insights for future projects in vehicle design and engineering.
